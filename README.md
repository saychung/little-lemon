After Initialising project and installing dependencies...
Run - 
 npm run dev to run a local server and the frontend scripts.


Else in case of Slow Internet or having installation issue with the dependecy packages, 
-you can visit:
https://main--effulgent-custard-a6ad7f.netlify.app/ which has the front end hosted,
https://little-lemon-server-61j1.onrender.com/ which has the backend json file,
https://github.com/saychung/little-lemon-server/tree/main which is the repo for the mock server,

Note: In the Netlify hosted website, The navbar does not show, along with it some components also does not show up,
I don't know why but in the localhost it shows. 
If you are visiting the netlify website then,
you can visit the reservation form via the button in the hero or the footer where the nav links are.
